      <h3>Description
        <h6>When attuned, the Storm Hat grants +2 to your Intelligence, as well as resistance to fire, cold and lightning damage. Also, once attuned, the Storm Hat begins to rain onto the head of the wearer. The intensity of the rain depends on how many charges the hat currently has, where 5 charges means torrential downpour and 0 charges means only a light mist. When attuned, the Storm Hat has 1d4 charges. While wearing this hat, as an action you can expend any number of charges to cast a spell from the list below with a spell level equal to the number of charges spent. DC 16. thunderclap, thunderwave, fog cloud, water breathing, tidal wave, watery sphere, maelstrom. The hat is linked to the elemental plane of water. Each time you use the hat to cast a spell, roll a d20 with a DC of 1 + (the spells level). On a failure, a creature from the elemental plane of water will be sucked through the hat to your plane. (The number and type of creatures that appear is up to the DM.) Any creature with a size greater than huge may take longer to be pulled all the way through, or may be only partially pulled through (ie. a kraken's tentacles. (Again, this is up to the DM.)) The hat regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn up to a maximum of 5 charges. Curse. This hat is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an Identify is cast on it, or you attune to it. Attuning to the hat curses you until you are targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic. While cursed, the hat cannot be removed from your head.</h6>
